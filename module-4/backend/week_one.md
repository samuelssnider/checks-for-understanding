Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's the most useful thing you learned from completing the intermission week work?
Basic syntax of javascript, and how logic looks basically the same in ruby and js. I also had a personal assignment using AJAX, similar to the module 3 lesson we had on AJAX. This helped me solidify some of the js/jQuery basics as well.
2. What are some tools to help debug JavaScript code?
Debugger, Console.log, and the many tools that the google chrome developer tools employ.
3. What are some tools you need in order to unit test your JavaScript?
Mocha is what we used in the prework and the week one assignments, but I know there are more options. Unit testing in the professional JS is prevalent where feature and model are not as much.
4. What is the syntax for invoking a function?
Parenthesis (empty or containing arguments) after a function name are required to invoke it, otherwise just the function itself is returned.
5. What is CORS?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. A mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to let a user agent gain permission to access selected resources from a server on a different origin than the site currently in use. Basically a user agent makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource from a different domain, protocol, or port that the one which the current document originated
6. How do we enable CORS?
A 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header will allow us on our project will override the default CORS protocol, and allow us to access different resources without changing the page.
7. What's `this` in JavaScript?
This is a complexity in js, but it basically comes down to a variable that changes based on the current scope. It is by default the window, but if its inside a function, it is that function itself. Using #.bind() 
8. What is Webpack and why is it useful?
9. When/why do you want to use event delegation?
10. What is a callback function?
11. What's `npm` and what do we use it for?
