## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's your favorite project management tool?
Waffle is my favorite its easy to use, well designed and user friendly, fully customizable.
2. Why do we create staging environments?
Staging is an essential part of the development cycle- we need to test our code in an environment that is a simulated production environment. A production environment has all sorts of pieces that a production one does not.
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
A good README will depend highly on what the repository is. If it is a gem file, for example, there should be instructions on how to install, what dependencies it has, how to get it to function with other common gems, and all the use cases. It should also provide some simple examples. If the repository is a project, it should have instructions on how to clone it, how to get the database created, migrated, and seeded, what packages/gems need to be installed with it. Every README should explain what the repository does, what languages it is written in/what languages it is compatible with and who it is for.
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
Making sure it is tab-able, and doing my best to have a site be logical and friendly to navigate for someone who is blind, color-blind, or has some kind of learning disability.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
Brute forcing passwords/tokens, simulating a trusted webpage, using parameters to get access to something not intended for that user. 
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
Continuous integration is essential because it allows testing for any tests breaking, database errors, code smells, and security venerabilities to be detected before the code is published.
7. What are some continuous integration tools?
Travis CI, Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab

#### Review  

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
Commits being squashed into individual features or updates, good commit messages, with thorough pull requests notes pertaining to all the code that was touched, what issues/cards were addressed, and who should review the code. Code review that is thorough and lays out concerns/inconsistencies/problems.
9. What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
10. What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?
A module has functions that manipulate data, but it does not any state, like a class has. There can be many instances of a class that look different, but instances of a module would all look the same.
