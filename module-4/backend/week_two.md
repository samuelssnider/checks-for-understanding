## Week Two - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?
Arrow functions are available in ES6, as are classes, both of which are not in ES5
2. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript?
Asynchronous JS allows the use of tools provided in the browser to execute tasks concurrently with the main javascipt thread, that are then rendered once the stack is empty.
3. What are the four pillars of Object Oriented programming?
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation.
4. What are some tools available in JavaScript to help you write object oriented code?
The class tools available in ES6 allow us to create Objects similar to how we would in an Object-Oriented language
5. What are some key concepts to be aware of when refactoring your JavaScript?
Similar to other languages, we want to keep our code DRY, with single responsibility in each method. We want repeatable code that can be used in many situations.
6. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?
Passing a function to a method in simplest terms. This allows us to tighten the scope inside the function, and is sometimes referred to as closure.
7. What's the scope of variables in Javascript?
There are two scopes of variables in javascript- global for anything outside a function, local for anything inside a function.
8. What's the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
== is equal to disregarding type, so strings can '==' numbers.
=== is equal to and equal type, so strings can't '===' numbers
9. Why do front end frameworks exist?
Front end frameworks exist to give your code structure for complex user interactions, they are not required but the norm in the industry is to take advantage of all the tools and organization they provide.

10. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?
HTTP is stateless, it does not 'hang on' to any state or information offered by the user; this information (essential to authorization and authentication), is stored on the client side in sessions and cookies.
11. Describe a RESTful API.
RESTful APIs take use of RESTful principles, and are limited to the same system of index, show, create, update, delete, that are common across RESTful principle adhering web applications. They make things more standardized, and easier to figure out for those not familiar with the code base.
12. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
13. What are some advantages **and** disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
